The phylogenetic tree demonstrates the evolutionary relationship between the query sequence and its closest homologs, revealing that the query is deeply nested within a clade of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The extremely short horizontal branch lengths connecting the query to the top database hits (strains AMC116165, L2304797, and M7233093) indicate high sequence conservation and a very recent common ancestor. This tight clustering suggests that the gene identified as a small heat shock protein is a stable part of the Klebsiella plasmid-borne genome. The tree topology confirms that the unknown sequence is not an isolated mutation but is part of a widely distributed and evolutionarily successful lineage of stress-response genes shared across multiple pathogenic strains.
