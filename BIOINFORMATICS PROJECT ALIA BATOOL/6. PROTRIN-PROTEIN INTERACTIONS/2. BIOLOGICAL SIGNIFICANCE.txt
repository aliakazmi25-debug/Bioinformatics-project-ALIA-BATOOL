Functional Interpretation of the PPI Network:
	
The STRING interaction map reveals that the query protein belongs to a highly interconnected chaperone network essential for bacterial survival under stress. The identified interaction partners, such as ibpA, ibpB, htpG, and clpB, are all well-known molecular chaperones that cooperate to maintain proteostasis. Specifically, ibpA and ibpB are small heat-shock proteins that work in tandem with the query protein to sequester misfolded proteins, while clpB and htpG (Hsp90 family) act downstream to actively refold these substrates. The dense web of connections (high edge confidence) signifies that these proteins do not function in isolation but are part of a coordinated "multichaperone system". This network is biologically significant because it provides Klebsiella pneumoniae with a robust defense mechanism against protein aggregation caused by heat, oxidative stress, or antibiotic exposure, thereby enhancing the overall fitness and pathogenicity of the strain
