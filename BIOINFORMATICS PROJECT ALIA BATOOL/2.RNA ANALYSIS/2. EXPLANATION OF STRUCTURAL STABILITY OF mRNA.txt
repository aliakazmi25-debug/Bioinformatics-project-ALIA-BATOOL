The predicted secondary structure for the mRNA sequence was generated using the Minimum Free Energy (MFE) model, which identifies the most thermodynamically stable conformation. The optimal secondary structure exhibits a highly complex arrangement of multiple stem-loops (hairpins), internal loops, and multiloop junctions. This structure is characterized by a very high thermodynamic stability, as evidenced by a significantly low Minimum Free Energy (dG) of -217.30 kcal/mol. Such a strongly negative MFE value indicates that the RNA molecule will spontaneously fold into this stable configuration. This structural stability is biologically essential, as it helps protect the mRNA from premature degradation by ribonucleases and can play a critical role in regulating the rate of translation by managing ribosome access to the transcript.
