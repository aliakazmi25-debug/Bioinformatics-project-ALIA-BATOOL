The BLASTn analysis of the unknown DNA sequence reveals a perfect match (100% Identity and 100% Query Coverage) to three different plasmids of Klebsiella pneumoniae (strains AMC116165, L2304797, and M7233093). The E-value of 0.0 indicates that these alignments are highly significant and not due to random chance. Because the 570 base-pair sequence is identical across different strains but located at varying genomic coordinates on their respective plasmids, it can be interpreted as a highly conserved genetic element. This suggests that the query sequence likely represents a mobile gene, such as an antimicrobial resistance (AMR) marker or a virulence factor, which is being maintained or spread through horizontal gene transfer within Klebsiella pneumoniae populations.
