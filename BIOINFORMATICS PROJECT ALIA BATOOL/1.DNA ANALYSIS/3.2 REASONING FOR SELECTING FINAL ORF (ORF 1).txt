•Length (Longest ORF):
 In prokaryotes (like Klebsiella pneumoniae), the longest ORF in a sequence is statistically the most likely to be a functional, protein-coding gene. Short ORFs often occur by random chance, but a long continuous stretch without a stop codon (like your 570 bp query) usually indicates a real gene.

•Presence of Canonical Start/Stop Codons:
ORF 1 typically begins with the standard start codon (ATG) and ends with a recognized stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). The fact that ORF 1 spans the full length of your 570 bp sequence suggests it is a complete coding sequence (CDS).

•Alignment with Known Proteins: 
Since your earlier BLASTn results showed a 100% identity to Klebsiella plasmids, selecting the primary ORF (ORF 1) ensures that the translated protein will match known functional proteins (like antibiotic resistance enzymes) found in those plasmids.

•Frame and Strand Orientation: 
ORF 1 is usually in the +1 frame (the first reading frame). If this frame yields a 100% match in protein databases, it confirms that this is the "sense" strand being transcribed and translated
